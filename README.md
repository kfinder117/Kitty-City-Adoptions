# Kitty-City-Adoptions
Kevin Finder
This project is a webpage for a pet adoption website. Users are able to navigate through multiple pages, in order to apply for an adoption, view current pets available, and how to contact the location.
Mostly comprised of .html with some .css used.
Potential future improvements:
      Creating a volunteer page where users may volunteer at the location.
      Creating an FAQ page for users with common questions.
      Creating a donations page for users wanting to donate to the location
